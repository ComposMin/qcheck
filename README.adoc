= QCheck

QuickCheck inspired property-based testing for OCaml, and combinators to
generate random values to run tests on.

This library spent some time in
https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML[qtest], but is now
standalone again!

The documentation can be found https://c-cube.github.io/qcheck/[here].

Note that @gasche's [generator library](http://gasche.github.io/random-generator/doc/Generator.html)
can be useful too, for generating random instances.

== Use

See the documentation. I also wrote
[a blog post](http://cedeela.fr/quickcheck-for-ocaml.html) that explains
how to use it and some design choices.

== Build

    $ make

You can use opam:

    $ opam install qcheck

== License

The code is now released under the LGPL license.
